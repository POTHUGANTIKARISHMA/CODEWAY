            <P>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for the web that defines the structure of web pages.

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <P>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
               It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup language. 
              It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. 
              It can also be used with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL.

            <h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
            <P>JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages.
               It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. 
               It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, 
               it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers.
               With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time.
                The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.</P>

            <h2>SQL</h2>

              data manipulation operations on the data.
              It is a database language used for database creation, deletion, fetching and modifying rows, etc. sometimes, it is pronounced as 'sequel.'
               We can also use it to handle organized data comprised of entities (variables) and relations between different entities of the data.</P>
